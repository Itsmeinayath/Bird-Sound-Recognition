The following libraries are required to run the project. You can install them using the `pip install` command:

```bash
bash
Copy code
pip install <library_name>

```

Example:

```bash
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame

```

## Steps to Run the Project

### Step 1: Open the Project in VS Code

- Clone or download the project files.
- Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

### Step 2: Run the Main Script

- Locate the file named `bird.py` in the project directory.
- Run the script using the following command in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    python bird.py
    
    ```
    

### Step 3: Use the GUI Interface

1. **Choose File**: Click the "Choose File" button in the GUI to select an audio file from the dataset.
2. **Convert to MFCC**: Click the "Convert to MFCC" button to process the audio file.
3. **Analyze MFCC**: Click the "Analyze MFCC" button to analyze the extracted features.
4. **Listen to Audio**: Click the "Mel-Spectrogram" image to listen to the processed audio.
5. **Identify Bird**: Click the bird image to view details about the identified bird species.

## Key Features

- **Audio Analysis**: Processes bird sound files into MFCC and mel-spectrogram formats for deep learning analysis.
- **Bird Identification**: Identifies the bird species based on the input audio file.
- **Interactive GUI**: Easy-to-use interface for audio processing and bird recognition.
